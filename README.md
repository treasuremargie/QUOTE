Hi My name is Treasure , I am from Kenya . I love coding.

 I did my project website called Freespace .The website is  designed to  motivate young teens navigate through the challenges that affect their mental wellbeing.

 I created this website because as teens sometimes we are not able to know how deal with challenges.This website will give us tips on that.

 I made my project using HTML,CSS ,Javascript and hardwork and dedication.

 I had lots of challenges with css but i had to learn to be resilient with determination not to quit.
